# Diabetes-prediction-webapp
This is a Microsoft Azure web app. #diabetes_prediction_webapp The project uses a Kaggle database to let the user determine whether someone has diabetes by just inputting certain information such as BMI, glucose level, blood pressure, and so on.

â€¢ This repository consists of files required to deploy a ___Web App___ created with ___Flask___ on ___Microsoft___ Azure.# diabetes_prediction_webapp
The project uses a Kaggle database to let the user determine whether someone has diabetes by just inputting certain information such as BMI, glucose level, blood pressure, and so on.


The project will be able to tell the user if they have diabetes or not by entering certain values such as BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age, and so on, based on statistical data about how certain factors such as BMI, Glucose level, Insulin level, age, and so on influence whether or not a person is prone to diabetes. In this approach, the initiative will aid in the monitoring of the risk of getting diabetes. The project can be expanded to cover the prediction of additional diseases, which I will do later.
